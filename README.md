# Leader Guarantee

Guarantee a single "leader" not across a cluster of nodes.
Run a function when node becomes leader. Run another one (if required) when it doesn't.

## Install
In leiningen:

```
[leader-guarantee "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

In Maven:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>leader-guarantee</groupId>
  <artifactId>leader-guarantee</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```


## How to use
It's pretty easy.

```clojure
 (use 'leader-guarantee.core)

 (when-leader "my-cluster"
 	(println "I am leader! Feel my wrath!")
 	(initialise-something-that-can-only-run-on-one-node))
```

The leader will be the leader of the cluster for it's JVM's entire life. When the host JVM shuts down, then another node
in the cluster will take over.

## What?
Leader-gurantee (LG) is just a simple wrapper around [JGroups'](http://jgroups.org) [LockService](http://www.jgroups.org/javadoc/org/jgroups/blocks/locking/LockService.html).

+ LG uses UDP as its transport protocol - it uses the default UDP config, plus:
+ LG uses a Central controlled lock - see [CENTRAL_LOCK](http://www.jgroups.org/javadoc/org/jgroups/protocols/CENTRAL_LOCK.html)
